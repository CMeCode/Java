The objective of this Assignment was to develop five Java-based applications to gain experience using common functions.

The purpose of each application:
1. Display sum, product, difference, and quotient of two integers entered by user.
2. Calculates and prints the squares and cubes of all integers from 0 to 10, in table format.
3. Allows user to enter a list of items sold by a salesperson, then uses the list to calculate their commission.
4. Calculates and prints the factorials of all integers from 1 to 5, in table format.
5. Prints the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas" using switches and loops (minimizing the length of code).

The code is intentially heavily commented.
